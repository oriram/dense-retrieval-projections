# Dense Retrieval as Distrubtions Over the Vocabulary

The paper [*What Are You Token About?* Dense Retrieval as Distributions Over the Vocabulary](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.10380) was published at ACL 2023.

In the paper, we propose to interpret the vector representations produced by dual encoders by projecting them into the modelâ€™s vocabulary space, and show nice properties of these projections.

[We created a notebook that examplifies how to project representations to the vocabluray space.](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1GNwG7rUV2AgyDm7Na4r8dOZTrLYHFEkA?authuser=1#scrollTo=Eu2i3eji6ibP).
